Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no fools for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be
Tell nobody I control you
I broke you just to own you
They can't tell that I love you
'Cause you're loyal, baby
I love when you're submissive
Love it when I break skin
You feel pain without flinchin'
So say it
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kinda love
Push me and choke me 'til I pass out
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh
Push me down, hold me down
Spit in my mouth while you turn me on
I wanna take your light inside
Dim me down, snuff me out
Hands on my neck while you push it out
And I'm screamin' out
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kinda love
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (tonight)
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no (oh)
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh
Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no fools for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be
Top of the world but I'm still not free
It's such a secret that I keep
Until it's gone, I can never find peace
Brace my whole life just to be
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (tonight)
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no (oh)
I just wann–∞ be one of your girls tonight, oh (oh)
